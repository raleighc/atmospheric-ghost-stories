## Title

Cryptic Encounters

## Description

This project is a walk-through of a haunted house in which the user can interact with the spirits inside in different ways to get different dialogue responses and therefore, a different version of the spirits' stories. The user finds themselves trapped in a haunted house, and is instructed by a greeter ghost to speak with each of the ghosts in the house before being allowed to leave. Each spirit has a story, and you have to help them tell their story and escape, or you'll become trapped too!

## Further_Development

1. We would like to include a system that, upon successfully completing dialogue with a spirit on a positive note, the user can choose to free the ghost from the house by giving the spirit a special key. This way, we could add in a feature that allows the user to "win" or "lose" the game depending on whether or not they have freed all of the ghosts from the house.

2. We could make spirit dialogue responses factor-in the user's inputted age and gender to further customize the spirits' dialogue with the user.

3. We could add more spirits in the house, all with different stories and dialogue trees.

4. We could add more dialogue options and expand the complexity of the interactions.

5. We could add atmospheric background sounds of an creaky, old house to further increase the user immersion.

6. We could create a ghost story generator that would inject pieces of a conversation into the dialogue of one or more spirits or the user, depending on a variety of factors, including additional user input and a ghost's character traits. This would significantly increase the variety of dialogue options we could add.
